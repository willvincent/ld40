# My LD40 Game

## Ludum Dare 40

This game was created as part of the Ludum Dare 40, Dec 1 - 3, 2017.

The theme: _The more you have, the worse it is_


## Game Objective

Survive / Escape a maze. As you traverse the maze you will encounter areas with an attractant that will lure more and more creatures toward you. You have _no defense_ other than to run away!
Luckily, the effects of this attractant wear off over time, so the longer you last without acquiring more the fewer creatures will be stalking you through the maze.

# Maze Trudger

You've found yourself in an intricate maze. You must trudge all the way to the furthest south-eastern most point to escape. Along the way you will encounter a great deal of some sort of sticky, smelly muck that you will have to trudge through as there is no way around it. Unfortunately this muck sticks to you, and when it's disturbed a strong odor emits from it that gets some maze creatures all riled up, causing them to have the seemingly insatiable desire to go for a jog through the maze. The more muck you disturb, the more likely it is that you'll encounter one of them -- or that they'll encounter you.  While they _probably_ won't chase you, as your paths cross it is likely they'll take a little nip (or maybe more than just a little), and your only defense is to run away.

You'll also find health packs scattered about to recouperate from those pesky bites, and flares that you can launch to briefly illuminate parts of the unknown maze. Good luck, you may or may not get out alive,but every maze is different...

## Ludum Dare 40

This game was created as part of the Ludum Dare 40, Dec 1 - 3, 2017.

The theme: _The more you have, the worse it is_


## Game Objective

Survive / Escape a maze. As you traverse the maze you will encounter areas with an attractant that will lure more and more creatures toward you. You have _no defense_ other than to run away!
Luckily, the effects of this attractant wear off over time, so the longer you last without acquiring more the fewer creatures will be stalking you through the maze.
